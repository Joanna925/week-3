This week things started getting clear, and I started to get an idea of where i am and where i am going witht the practices. Regex does the primary cleaning and openreifne tidies the data up after that. Regular historians might have shown their work in an old school way where you have to dive in to find information, and usually it takes quite a long time to sort out a piece of information form the "sea". However digital historian are putting the same content in a different form where information could be sorted out and made use of without wasting too much time. Tools like regex and openrefine save an insanely amount of time for historians as well as data scientists on their research, so that they could focus more on the information and research itself instead of spending too much time on tidying up the mess.
